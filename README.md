The challenge in this project is:</br>
<ol>
<li>Using a appropriate object-oriented design:</br></li>
1. I have designed three classes: </br>
2. Constant class to store constant variables: 5 constant variables and not methods.</br>
3. Visitor class for visitors: 2 attributes, and 5 methods (3 void methods). </br>
4. Generator class for random number generation: 3 methods all returning String values.</br>
</br>
<Li>Design tests to cover all 5 methods with returning values.</br></li>
1. I have designed 4 test classes with total 13 tests, which cover all of the 5 methods with returning values.</br>
2. I have included test cases of edge case, boundary values, euqivalence, and expected exceptions.</br>
