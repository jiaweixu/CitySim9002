## Jiawei XU (jix20)

The challenge in this project is:</br>
1. Using a appropriate object-oriented design:
..1. I have designed three classes: 
..2. Constant class to store constant variables: 5 constant variables and not methods
..3. Visitor class for visitors: 2 attributes, and 5 methods (3 void methods) 
..4. Generator class for random number generation: 3 methods all returning String values.
2. Design tests to cover all 5 methods with returning values
..1. I have designed 4 test classes with total 13 tests, which cover all of the 5 methods with returning values
..2. I have included test cases of edge case, boundary values, euqivalence, and expected exceptions.
